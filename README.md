# Overview
This repository is created to answer Mid Test Astra Data Scientist Bootcamp 2019 on 10 October 2019. There are 3 use case questions : <br>
1. [Annual Water Usage in Baltimore](https://github.com/hmaghfira/Mid-Test-ADSB2019/tree/master/%231)<br>
**Background :** The Dataset provides the annual water usage in Baltimore from 1885 to 1963, or 79 years of data.
The values are in the units of liters per capita per day, and there are 79 observations.<br>
**Objective :** The Problem is to predict annual water usage.<br>
**Dataset :** water.csv (already uploaded in the folder).

2. [Apartment Price in Victoria](https://github.com/hmaghfira/Mid-Test-ADSB2019/tree/master/%232)<br>
**Background :** The Dataset provides living area and conservation status. There are 218 observations and 16 variables.<br>
**Objective :** The Problem is to determine the best model and give the reason. Tony who has profession as a broker wants to predict apartment price in Victoria based on living area environment and apartment conservation status. Determine the best model to predict and redefine new conservation variable in 3 level, A = 1A, B = 2A, C = 2B and 3A.<br>
**Dataset :** victoria.csv (already uploaded in the folder).

3. [Titanic](https://github.com/hmaghfira/Mid-Test-ADSB2019/tree/master/%233)<br>
**Background :** The dataset contains data for 887 of the real Titanic passengers. Each row represents one person. The columns describe different attributes about the person including whether they survived (S), their age (A), their passenger-class (C), their sex (G) and the fare they paid (X). The table below shows the Data Dictionary.<br>
**Objective :** Create a python script that contains the script to answer the questions. Put comments on the script to show which line of codes answers which questions.<br>
**Dataset :** titanic.csv (already uploaded in the folder).

# Getting Started
The code was developed by using Jupyter Notebook. The detail explanation can be seen on each python file.
